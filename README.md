Parser for ELibrary Database

This project is aimed to simplify theme-search in different knowledge bases, such as [elibrary](https://elibrary.ru/defaultx.asp).

You may set some theme as input string and output will contain most famous authors from different author groups. 
*Attention:* search requires some limitations, because of elibrary parse limitations.
